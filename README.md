## Introduction
Project ATMA (Artifial Tragedy Monitor and Autoresponder) is an Artificial Intelligence platform
that is able to recognize violent crime, fires, and medical tragedies. Millions of people across
the world are victims of such situations and we at Project ATMA believe there's way to reduce and
hopefully one day eliminate such tragedies.

Project ATMA makes use of Transfer Values (features) and ResNet50 pre-trained model
in order to re-train a model's trained weights to recognize crimes without the need
to train the full model from scratch (which usually requires a large amount of data).
